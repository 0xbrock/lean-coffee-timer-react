# Lean Coffee Timer React

This is a simple timer to facilitate Lean Coffee.

This is a beta ReactJS port of the AngularJS [Lean Coffee Timer](https://0xbrock.github.io/LeanCoffeeTimer/) I wrote a couple years ago.

LeanCoffeeTimer repo: https://github.com/0xbrock/LeanCoffeeTimer

## Build and Development
Run `yarn start`

## Production Build
Run `yarn build`

## Next Steps
* Refactor the timer functionality with Redux.
